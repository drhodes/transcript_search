* Transcript search for 6.004.2x
** Description
Until edx gets a search feature for transcripts, this should suffice.
It's not pretty, but it works without any backend. If you want to add
something, then clone, hack and pull request. I'll most likely merge it.



** Features
- Allow users to search the transcripts.
- Updates result on the fly.
- Supply URLs back to the edx platform.
- Supply transcript snippets.
- Specify lecture or worked example by #LEC or #WE
 


*** TODO
- Automate .srt file scraping and link generation 
  
- don't add results one by one, add them in one big chunk, those Dom
  manipulation seem slow.  (how to measure this?)

- add pdfs to the mix
  


** Considerations
- Don't need to optimize this, the data set is small.  linear search
  should work fine! If it slows down later, then add a reasonable index

- Should run completely in javascript

- python will rummage around and emit a json blob that can be embedded
  in a single html file for people to run locally if they want, or
  access directly from github.

- simple UI

** UI
- A form field with update-as-you-type search results.
